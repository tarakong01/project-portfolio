						<p>As a software member of Thunderbots,  UBCâ€™s autonomous robot soccer design team, a major project I took on 
                            was implementing a portion of the gameplay logic, the goalie tactic, as a state-machine. In C++, I developed 
                            the states, events, and transitions of the state-machine, which defined behaviour for blocking and intercepting, 
                            clearing, and tracking the ball. Furthermore, I designed simulated integration tests that ran the software 
                            through a sequence of events, using validation functions to verify that the robot performed the correct state 
                            transition and associated actions. The purpose of implementing gameplay as a state-machine was to make our code 
                            more modular, templatized, and scalable, which allowed for quicker debugging and accommodated further development 
                            in the future by other team members.

                            <b><i>Find best position</i></b>: the goalie positions itself between the ball and the goal<br/>
                            <b><i>Block ball</i></b>: the goalie moves to intercept, and automatically clears the ball on interception<br/>
                            <b><i>Clear ball</i></b>: the goalie intercepts the ball, then dribbles to an appropriate location to clear it<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Events:<br/>
                            <i><b>panic</b></i>: ball is moving faster than the panic speed threshold, and toward the goal<br/>
                            <i><b>safe</b></i>: ball is outside of the friendly defence area, and not moving above the panic threshold<br/>
                            <i><b>caution</b></i>: ball is inside the friendly defence area but not moving above the panic threshold<br/></p>
