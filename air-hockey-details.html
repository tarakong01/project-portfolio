						<p>For my capstone project, I am designing the electrical system of a robotic 
                            AI air hockey table. The short term goal of this project is to take on human opponents 
                            and beat them in a game of air hockey; the long term purpose is to serve as a physical 
                            agent on which to train the AIâ€™s of engineering physics students in a future project course.
                            This project is multidisciplinary as it consists of mechanical, electrical, software, and AI 
                            subteams, and each subteam has been doing thorough research to gain expertise in their field.<br/></p>

                        <p>On the electrical side, we have been extensively researching the theory and applications of power 
                            electronics, especially motors, motor drives and controllers, switching power supplies, and batteries, 
                            and are in discussion with various companies to help with speccing our system. We have also begun 
                            preliminary circuit analysis to understand how the components are integrated together and how they 
                            behave with respect to current and voltage. Currently, major considerations include handling flyback 
                            voltage due to deceleration of the motors, supplying a steady power output in the face of large current 
                            spikes, and integrating different control methods in our electrical design, such as feedback and feedforward loops.<br/><br/>
                            Before finalising any components or specifications, we are building a MATLAB Simulink model to gain an in-depth 
                            understanding of the behaviour of our system. By using mathematical principles to relate the physical load such 
                            as mass and inertia with the proposed motion trajectories, the model will be a useful and necessary guide in 
                            determining the torque and power requirements of the system, from which we will be able to move forward with component selection.
