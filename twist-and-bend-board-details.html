						<p>During my term at Kardium, I worked on the PCB of a production jig that applied pressure to bend certain parts of the device. The role 
                            of the PCB and firmware was to initiate, monitor, and shut off the pressure output at a given threshold. 
                            To reduce time spent manufacturing and maintaining the jig, I was tasked with removing the pressure sensing logic originally performed 
                            in the hardware and converting it into firmware, and updating the schematic and PCB accordingly.<br/><br/>
                            To update the firmware, I wrote C to program an Arduino MKR Wifi 1010. I utilized timers and interrupts and the onboard analog comparator and 
                            ADC to read and compare analog values from the pressure sensors. On the electrical side, I updated the existing schematic and PCB by removing unneeded components, replacing obsolete parts with newly sourced 
                            components, and resizing components as needed to reflect any other changes made.<br/><br/>
                            My main takeaway from this project was learning to pick up from someone else's work and quickly familiarize myself with all the existing functions 
                            and design choices. This was especially important to ensure that any new components or functionality that I added were compatible with the existing features and matched the component specifications.
