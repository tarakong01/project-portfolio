						<p>The goal of this 3-person project was to design, prototype, and implement a fully autonomous robot that 
                            could traverse an 8 square-foot section of floor, detect and collect empty pop cans lying around, and 
                            deposit them vertically in a designated dropoff box. I largely contribute to the software and mechanical 
                            design.<br/><br/>
                            The software was implemented on an STM32 BluePill microcontroller, in the form of a state-machine 
                            in C++ to account for the various different behaviours: driving, picking up and storing a can, and depositing 
                            cans at the dropoff box. Furthermore, line-following driving was implemented with reflectance sensors located 
                            on the underside of the robot, paired with PID control.</br><br/>
                            The mechanical design went through several iterations - the main factor behind our final design was having an 
                            intermediate storage system that could store multiple cans vertically, in such a way as to make the final dropoff as simple as possible.<br/><br/>
                            I also contributed to the electrical system by hand-soldering and debugging various circuits, including an H-bridge motor driver.

                        <p>The biggest challenge of this project was the integration of the sub-systems.
                        For example, integrating the software into the mechanical system introduced issues regarding inertia and imbalance that 
                        our software didn't account for before - as a result, we spent a lot of time tuning our software to compensate for these disturbances. 
                        Another challenge we faced was that this project occurred during the COVID lockdown. Being remote, we didnâ€™t have access to the machine shop 
                        or hands-on assistance from our instructors. To overcome these obstacles, we underwent lots of prototyping and built our robots using hand tools and corrugated plastic, 
                        and communicated regularly and effectively to meet tight deadlines. In the final course competition, our robots placed 3rd out of 16 teams.</p>
