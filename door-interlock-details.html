						<p>One of the projects I took on during my co-op term at Kardium was designing an electromechanical
                             system to control a 3-door entrance to the production cleanroom. The door-interlock system 
                             consisted of solid-state relays, reed sensors, electromagnetic locks, and LED lamps.<br/><br/>
                            I designed the electrical schematic and wiring diagram, using digital logic to implement each of
                             the allowed states. Components were selected with consideration to power consumption, inrush current,
                              and operation time and frequency, then tested to ensure they met the specifications. I also had the
                               opportunity to build the enclosure for the system using a bandsaw, drill press, and hand tools, and
                                was heavily involved in the final installation of the system into the cleanroom.<br/><br/>
                            My biggest takeaways from this project were the experience of owning a project from start to finish,
                             and making design choices based on how a system would be physically integrated into the environment itâ€™s operating in.
