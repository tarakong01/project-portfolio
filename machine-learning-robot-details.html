						<p>In this 2-person project, I implemented an autonomous agent to navigate a simulated world and detect and read 
                            licence plates off of parked cars. The simulated world was created in a Linux-based environment, using Gazebo 
                            and ROS. The code for this project was written in Python: navigation and plate detection utilised OpenCV to 
                            process frames from the simulated camera feed, using techniques such as binary masking, contouring, and perspective 
                            transformation; and reading the captured licence plates was achieved by training the CNN via Tensorflow/keras. 
                            Our initial plate detection strategy used the SIFT algorithm, which relies on a reference image in order to find 
                            matches in features between the reference image and the test image. In the context of this project, this was unideal 
                            since the licence plates were all different - there weren’t enough similarities between any two plates, and setting 
                            the threshold too low resulted in more inaccuracies.

                        <p>The challenge of this course was in providing enough quantity and variation of the sample images to train the CNN. 
                            Certain letters and numbers had very close likeness, such as “5” and “S”, which made it more difficult for our CNN to 
                            consistently guess the correct characters.
